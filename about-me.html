                    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
                    My name is Gonzalo Passano and I'm a design major, thanks for checking out my site. To start things off I should probably mention that I started out late in the whole design business, for I only really started to get into it by the time I started college, so I ain't a wiz at it yet, but I have an understanding on what makes a design stand out. I'm constantly learning new things to help me improve on skills I already know, and new techniques/programs that could make future jobs easier.
                    <br><br/>
                    Throughout this site you can have a look at my past works that I've done in and out of college, and it may look like a begginner's work, but it gradually gets better as you scroll along. I'm still in college in the pursuit of obtaining my BA in Design from Queens College.
