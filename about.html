<p>Throughout my courses at Queens College, we have worked on many projects that required the use of many different software as well as design concepts. This has resulted in my improving my creative abilities and knowledge as a designer. I am Proficient Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Bridge, Lightroom and Sony Vegas. I am knowledgeable in color theory, graphic design, digital image-making, illustration, and typography. I also have some knowledge of html and css.</p>
 
<p>Previously I graduated from Baruch College with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing. I'm proficient in Microsoft Office, Quickbooks so I think I could be a good fit in almost any area of a business.
I am currently working as a Spanish translator as well as as in market research.</p>
